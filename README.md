BarcodEx extracts UMIs using either a pattern sequence or a regular expression and appends the concatenated UMIs to the read name preceded by a separator string specified in the command. 
UMIs can be extracted from read 1 and/or read 2 using respectively ```--pattern1``` and ```--pattern2```. At leat 1 pattern must be used. When extracting UMIs in read 1 and read 2, ```--pattern1``` and ```--pattern2``` must be both either a string sequence or a regular expression.
Reads that are not matching the provided patterns are discarded. Discarded reads are written to file for inspection. Morover, the extracted sequences are also recovered and written to file.
```--prefix``` specifies the start of the output files. (e.g ```--prefix``` x will result in x_R1.fastq.gz, x_R1.discarded.fastq.gz, x_R1.extracted.fastq.gz, x_UMI_counts.json, x_extraction_metrics.json) 


### Extraction with a string pattern ###

The pattern sequence must include one or more Ns, indicating the UMI bases, optionally followed by any nuccleotides corresponding to spacer sequence. 
For instance the pattern ```NNNNN``` extracts the first 5 nucleotides from the read whereas pattern ```NNNNNATCG``` extracts the first 9 nucleotides, appends nucleotides 1-5 to the read name and discard spacer ```ATCG```. Reads not matching ```NNNNNATCG``` are discarded. 

Extraction with the pattern sequence always extracts UMIs at the beginning of the read sequence. Extraction with regular expression offers more flexibility in the UMI design (see below).

As an example, consider read:

```
@MISEQ753:39:000000000-BDH2V:1:1101:17521:1593 1:N:0:
TCATGTCTGCTAATGGGAAAGAGTGTCCTAACTGTCCCAGATCGTTTTTTCTCACGTCTTTTCTCCTTTCACTTCTCTTTTTCTTTTTCTTTCTTCTTCTT
+
1>1A1DDF11DBDGFFA111111D1FEEG31AD1DAA1110BA00000//01A2A/B/B/212D2111D1222D12122B1B01D1@101112@D2D12BB
```

Extraction with pattern ```NNNNNNNNNNNNATGGGAAAGAGTGTCC``` will extract UMI ```TCATGTCTGCTA``` and add it to the read name. Spacer sequence ```ATGGGAAAGAGTGTCC``` is removed from read.
So the new read is now:

```
@MISEQ753:39:000000000-BDH2V:1:1101:17521:1593_TCATGTCTGCTA 1:N:0:
TAACTGTCCCAGATCGTTTTTTCTCACGTCTTTTCTCCTTTCACTTCTCTTTTTCTTTTTCTTTCTTCTTCTT
+
G31AD1DAA1110BA00000//01A2A/B/B/212D2111D1222D12122B1B01D1@101112@D2D12BB
```

Extracted sequence ```TCATGTCTGCTAATGGGAAAGAGTGTCC``` and its corresponding qualities ```1>1A1DDF11DBDGFFA111111D1FEE``` can be written to fastq file with option ```--keep_extracted``` (see below).

### Extraction with a regular expression ###

Regular expressions allow more flexibility for extracting UMIs, in particular UMIs with complex design and UMIs not starting at the beginning of the read.
A good introduction to regular expression can be found in this [Regular Expression HOWTO](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html). 
BarcodEx depends on the ```regex``` module rather than the standard ```re``` module because the former allows fuzzy matching.

Sequences are extracted from the read using named groups within the regex. Allowed named groups are ```umi``` and ```discard```. Syntax with named groups is as follow:
```(?<umi>.{3})(?<discard>T{2})```: extracts a 3bp UMI followed by TT spacer that is removed from read and discarded
The ```discard``` group removes nucleotides and qualities from the read while the ```umi``` group extracts the UMI that gets added to the read name.
Any sequence not contained in ```umi``` and ```discard``` groups will remain in the read. Thus, it is important to construct the regular expression such that the begining of the read is captured in groups.

For instance, consider the following read:

```
@MISEQ753:39:000000000-BDH2V:1:1101:17521:1593 1:N:0:
AATCGTCCATCG
+
1>1A1DDF11DB
```

The regex ```(?<umi>.{3})(?<discard>C{2})``` will extract UMI ```CGT``` and discard spacer ```CC```. But the first 3 nucleotides ```AAT``` will remain in the read with new read being:

```
@MISEQ753:39:000000000-BDH2V:1:1101:17521:1593_CGT 1:N:0:
AATATCG
+
1>111DB
```

To prevent the ```AAT``` before the UMI ```CGT``` to be part of the read, we need to account for the nucleotides upstream in the UMI in the regex ```(?<discard1>^.*)(?<umi>.{3})(?<discard2>C{2})```

```
@MISEQ753:39:000000000-BDH2V:1:1101:17521:1593_CGT 1:N:0:
ATCG
+
11DB
```

The extracted sequences and qualities can be recovered with option ```--keep_extract``` which writes the following read to file (see below).

```
@MISEQ753:39:000000000-BDH2V:1:1101:17521:1593_CGT 1:N:0:
AATCGTCC
+
1>1A1DDF
```

Multiple ```umi``` and ```discard``` named groups are allowed within the regex but they should be named differently. Naming is not important as long as groups contain the strings ```umi``` and ```discard```without special characters.
For instance the following 2 regex will give the same output:
- ```(?<discard_1>^.*)(?<umi>.{3})(?<discard_a>C{2})')``` and ```(?<discard1>^.*)(?<umi>.{3})(?<discard2>C{2})')```
- ```(?P<umi_1>^[ACGT]{3}[ACG])(?P<discard_1>T)|(?P<umi_2>^[ACGT]{3})(?P<discard_2>T)``` and ```(?P<umi_a>^[ACGT]{3}[ACG])(?P<discard_a>T)|(?P<umi_b>^[ACGT]{3})(?P<discard_b>T)```

### Filtering extracted UMIs against a list ###

The UMIs will only be accepted if they match an allow list provided with --umilist.
The list is a text file with one UMI per line. In the case of 2 reads with embedded UMIs, the two parts of the UMI must be on separate lines, optionally followed by the read number they apply to.
So, AAA would be allowed for either read 1 or read 2, while CCC 2 will allow CCC only on read 2.
It's also possible to write AAA 1 2 or AAA 1 and AAA 2 if desired.
 

### Extraction of UMIs in single or paired read sequences ### 

Single and paired end read data are indicated with the option ```--data single``` or ```--data paired``` respectively.
For paired end data with inline UMIs, options ```--r1_in``` and ```r2_in``` indicate the paths to the read 1 and read 2 fastqs.
BarcodEx requires gzipped input fastqs and outputs gzipped fastqs. Input fastqs for paired end data must be in sync.
```--prefix``` specifies the start of the output files (e.g. foo/bar/x_R1.fastq.gz, foo/bar/x_R2.fastq.gz)
Only ```r1_in``` is required for single end data with inline UMIs. 
 

### Extraction from multiple input fastqs ###

Multiple input fastqs can be processed together for read 1 and/or read 2 but generating a single output fastq for single end data and 2 output fastqs for paired read data.
The files mut be passed to ```--r1_in``` for read 1 fastqs and ```--r2_in``` for read 2 fastqs, each file being separated by white space.
The number of input fastqs for paired data must be the same for read 1 and read 2 and each list of files must be in the same order.

### Extraction of UMIs not inline with reads ###

With option ```--inline```, BarcodEx expects UMIs to be inline with the read.
For some library types, such as sureselect and haloplex, the UMIs are not inline but are located in a separate fastq. Omitting ```--inline``` assumes UMIs to be in a fastq file. This file is indicated with ```--r2_in``` for single end data and ```--r3_in``` for paired end data.
With UMIs in file, ```--pattern1``` is used to extract UMIs from ```--r2_in``` or ```--r3_in``` and ```--pattern2``` is not used.

### Recovering discarded reads and extracted sequences ###

Reads without a matching pattern are written to file for inspection. ```--prefix``` specifies the start of the output files (e.g. foo/bar/x_R1.discarded.fastq.gz).
Extracted read sequences (UMIs and any spacer sequence removed from read, along with their qualities) are also written as a fastq file (e.g. foo/bar/x_R1/R2.extracted.fastq.gz for inline UMIs, and x_extracted.R2/3.fastq for UMIs located in files).
The fastqs with extracted sequences can be used with the main output fastqs to re-generate the original fastqs.


### UMIs and reads metrics ###

Two files with metrics of the UMI extraction are written in json format in the same directory specified by ```--prefix```.
```--prefix``` foo/bar/x results in  foo/bar/x_extraction_metrics.json and foo/bar/x_UMI_counts.json.
The first json captures information about the extraction process:
- total reads/pairs processed
- number reads/pairs with matching pattern
- numberreads/pairs with non-matching pattern
- pattern1
- pattern2
- umi-list

The second json records the UMI counts after extraction. For paired end data it counts the concatenated sequences with UMIs from read 1 and read 2, but adding a "." separator to track the read origin of each UMI.
For instance, "AAA.TCG": 10 in the json file indicates that sequence AAATCG is found 10 times in all the extracted UMIs, and that it is made of AAA from read 1 and TCG from read 2. One can then easily obtain counts of all UMIs from read 1 and read 2.


### Importing Barcodex as a module ###

BarcodEx can be run as a script or imported as a module to perform extraction within your own script.
The recommended import is ```from barcodex import extract_barcodes```. Dependent modules must also be imported (see Example command #8 below).
